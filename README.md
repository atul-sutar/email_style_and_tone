Sub.: Request for approval: attending the Extreme Programming workshop

Dear Ms G,

I wish to request your approval for attending the Extreme Programming training programme being offered at Coimbatore. As a part of my duties in Business Innovation, I have been doing a lot of research into Extreme Programming recently. This is an area that has much potential as a new methodology for our use.

Our branch does not offer this training; the Learning Officer told me that a workshop on this subject would be conducted at Coimbatore from August 2nd to 5th.

I am well on track with my work on the ABC Project and expect to submit my report by July 25th. I shall ensure that there will be no pending work before I go for the workshop. I would also be pleased to conduct a knowledge sharing session for our Group on this topic, after I return.

Would you please approve this request ?

Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
AS

- Use of polite language such as 'would you mind', 'I am afraid.'
- Avoiding the use of slang or jargon.
- Use of formal words like 'assistance' instead of 'help', 'inform' instead of 'tell/say'.
- Using a definite opening and closure.
- Ensuring contractions/abbreviations are used sparingly.

Factors Involving Style - Politeness

Polite language is often considered by Indians as formal language. Many native speakers are always polite, though they may be informal. This is also true of many non-native speakers of European origin. It is necessary to be always polite even in informal conversations.

**Politeness - Examples**

- Use **I'd like** instead of I want, or I need
- '**I'd like to hear your proposal**', rather than 'I want to hear your proposal'
- '**Perhaps we should now consider...**' rather than 'Now, it's time to consider...'
- '**I'd require this file..**' instead of 'I need this fileâ€¦'
- '**I would like to attend this training**' and not 'I want to attend this training'

* * *

**Second Conditionals**

Use the second conditional:

|     |
| --- |
| **to appear more polite in making a request** |
| \- **Would** you **mind** if I **came** to work an hour late on Monday? |
| **to make a more delicate or indirect offer** |
| \- What **would** you **say** if we **improved** our delivery time? |
| \- If I **were** you I **would** write it differently. |

Softners

Use softeners to tone down your message especially while disagreeing:

|     |
| --- |
| **to appear more polite in making a request.** |
| \- I **was wondering** if I could come **a little** late on Monday. |
| \- **Actually**, that **may be rather** difficultâ€¦ |
| **To suggest an alternative** |
| \- Can we start the meeting at **9 a.m. instead of 8 a.m.**? |
| \- Why donâ€™t we ask Peter? |

* * *

**Use of** **please** **and** **kindly**

are often perceived as disguised orders. Instead of saying, 'Please pass the salt' it is better to say, 'Pass the salt please' and even better to say, 'Could you pass the salt, please?' Kindly is generally used only in notices.

| We write | We mean |
| --- | --- |
| You may like to investigate the matter. | You better investigate this matter. |
| I would appreciate an immediate reply. | I expect an immediate reply. |

* * *

**Example**
Instead of saying, 'I can't come on Wednesday', Native speakers may say, 'Monday would be more convenient'.

| Negative | Positive |
| --- | --- |
| \- tells the recipient what cannot be done | \- tells the recipient what can be done |
| \- has a subtle tone of blame | \- suggests alternatives and choices available to the recipient |
| \- includes words with a negative connotation | \- sounds helpful and encouraging rather than bureaucratic |
| \- does not stress positive actions that would be appropriate, or positive consequences | \- stresses positive actions and positive consequences that can be anticipated |
